  <h1>Pear Programming</h1>
  <section>
    <p>Welcome to Pear Programming, where Pair Programming + Pomodoro Technique = Power Programming Productivity! Let's go over our process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Pear Planning</span>: <span>pick</span> a <span>core</span> task; slice it up into smaller tasks. Then, bite off a small piece of each of those, and chew it into even smaller tasks. Maybe do it one more time. Ok, one more.
      </li>
      <li>
         <span>Pear Setup</span>: once your plan is all set, enter your names, and decide who will be navigator and driver first.
      </li>
      <li>
         <span>Pear Programming</span>: after each interval (we recommend 25 minutes to start), switch roles, review your code, and take a
        quick break. You earned it!
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Sweet sweet feedback</span>: your programming might be over, but the learning has just begun. Hit the feedback button for a sweet roadmap to problem solving nirvana. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Never let go, Jack</span>: if you you feel like you're drowning in cold cold code, click the "Halp!" button anytime, and we'll put you in touch with our in-house problem solving guru right away. 
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Before we get started, let's <span id="emphatic">plan</span> our work! Did you plan it? Are you sure? You're totally sure you have a plan? Ok, maybe go check once more. If you're not sure, here's this lovely quote from Abraham Lincoln about planning your work:</p>
    <p id="quote">"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." - Abraham Lincoln</p>
    <p>What are your names?</p>
